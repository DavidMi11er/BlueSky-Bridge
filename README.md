Over the last several years it has become increasingly apparent to me how important an open/decentralized social network is as a foundation for distributing information to the public. Because of that I was very excited when I first learned about the ActivityPub plugin that Matthias Pfefferle developed for WordPress which makes it possible for independent people to publish their own content out to the Fediverse. Considering that WordPress is also the backbone of many news organizations — especially smaller/local organizations — I loved how that simplified their barrier to entry into that decentralized social ecosystem.

It was actually a little bit disappointing for me that soon after I got that working BlueSky began to take off as a network because it introduced another open protocol which didn’t have a plugin for integrating with WordPress and the openness of the Atmosphere was more theoretical than the openness of the Fediverse (especially at that time).

When nobody seemed to be making a plugin for BlueSky/ATProtocol similar to the ActivityPub plugin I finally decided to write my own. I would love for someone to take this and run with it. In fact, ultimate success would be for Automattic to adopt a plugin with this functionality (or better) so that WordPress Authors have as easy access to the Atmosphere as they do to the Fediverse through the ActivityPub plugin.
