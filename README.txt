== Description ==

= Automated Syndication to BlueSky =

Publish post summary and permalink to a BlueSky account and capture replies on BlueSky as comments on the WordPress post. When publishing a post this plugin will craft a Bluesky post based on the post tags and the post excerpt while ensuring that it will not exceed the 300 character limit on BlueSky.

The post also checks BlueSky periodically for replies - the interval defaults to every 15 minutes but can be adjusted in the plugin options.
